  <brief>The pointers will be initialized for you</brief>
  <doc>You can use pointers to any type used in the previous examples including other serializable classes.

Note that pointers **can not be used for arrays** of elements **yet** due the methods can not know the lenght of that array,
so only the first element is serialized.
